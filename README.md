Proposal Title: How Much More Do We Need To Pay For Drugs?

Significance: 

In recent years, there have been many anecdote stories that prescription drug prices have risen a lot. Some drugs are so expensive that many patients cannot afford them anymore. The infamous examples include EpiPen and Daraprim. The striking drug price increase places massive pressure on patients. This proposal is for patients and people who hope to improve our healthcare system. My project can help patients choose the affordable drug. It can also help policymaking by providing detailed information about the degree of price change for different medications, and which groups of patients suffer most. 

Project overview:

The goal is to use publicly available data to answer the following questions: what are the general trends of drug prices change in recent years? What are the drug options for patients in each therapeutic class? Do they have cheap alternatives?  I also would like to compare drug price changes and  Medicaid/Medicare spending changes for those drugs because Medicaid and Medicare may be able to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies. In other words, patients covered by those programs may experience different price changes compared with other patients.  Finally, I plan to see whether the competition from generic drugs reduces drug prices. If so, the FDA can facilitate more accessible applications for generic drugs to lower drug prices.

Data Sources: 

The drug price information comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' National Average Drug Acquisition Cost dataset. I also use their Medicare and Medicaid Spending datasets. The National Drug Code Directory from FDA's website maps drugs to their therapeutic classes.

Preliminary analysis:

I have run a preliminary study of how drug prices change. The first graph shows how the average price level of drugs changes with time from 2014 to the beginning of this year. To compute the average price level, I normalize the prices of each drug by its price at the beginning of 2014. Then I calculate the average of those normalized prices. Therefore, the average price level tells, on average, how many times current drug prices are relative to their 2014 prices. Surprisingly, the graph shows that although the average price level of all drugs rose sharply from 2014 to 2016, it dropped after that. The prices of prescription drugs right now, on average, are only 20% higher than their rates six years ago.  I further separate drugs into brand-name and generic groups. It turns out that brand-name drug prices rose continuously in the past few years!  

Can we relax a little and recommend patients to stick with generic drugs? I plot the distributions of drug prices in 2020 relative to 2014 in the second graph. The boxplots imply that distributions of price changes are skewed. For generic drugs, although 75% of them do not have a sharp price increase, there are many outliers. Actually, for both generic and brand-name drugs, a small proportion of them experience a striking price increase. 

Following plans:

The preliminary analysis implies some patients suffer immensely. What if there is no generic option for a patient? Or what if even the generic drugs are very costly? To answer those questions, I  will study the prices of medications for each therapeutic class. I also plan to see how Medicare and Medicaid spendings have changed in each therapeutic class. 

I also intend to shed some light on the long-debating question: whether competition from generic drugs reduces brand-name drug prices. This requires me to match brand-name drugs with their generic substitutes. The generic information of a drug is available from Medicare and Medicaid spending datasets. 

These are what I am planning to do for my project.
